# Prolog

This repo groups together a series of programmes I started developing during the **Programming Languages and Methodologies** course, 
taken as part of my Advanced Master's in AI at KU Leuven.

Among others, some key concepts I have explored here are:

- Accumulators
- Binary trees
- Constraint logic programming (CLP)
- Definite clause grammar (DCG)
- Declarative and procedural meanings in Prolog
- Difference lists
- General prolog syntax
- Generate-and-test patterns
- Heuristic functions
- List manipulation
- Reification (conversion of value tests into booleans)
