# Prolog

This repo groups together a series of programmes I started developing during the **Programming Languages and Methodologies** course, 
taken as part of my Advanced Master's in AI at KU Leuven.

Among others, some key concepts I have explored here are:

- Binary Trees
- Constraint Logic Programming
- Declarative and procedural meanings in Prolog
- General Prolog Syntax
- Generate-and-test patterns
- List manipulation
